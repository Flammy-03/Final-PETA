## Game Overview

The Game Console allows players to enjoy two popular puzzle games:

- **Sudoku**: A logic-based number placement puzzle.
- **Minesweeper**: A strategy game focused on avoiding hidden mines.

## Sudoku

Sudoku is played on a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 subgrids. The objective is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each number appears only once in each row, column, and subgrid.

### How to Play

1. **Input Format**: Enter your move in the format `row col num`. For example, to place the number 5 in the cell at row 0, column 1, type `0 1 5`.

## Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a grid-based game where players must reveal squares without hitting mines. Each revealed square shows either a mine (game over) or a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to that square.

### How to Play

1. **Input Format**: Enter your move in the format `row col`. For example, to reveal the cell at row 1, column 2, type `1 2`.
2. **Game Over**: If you reveal a square containing a mine, the game ends.
3. **Revealing Squares**: You can only reveal one square at a time.

## Features

- **Clear Instructions**: Each game provides instructions to help players understand how to play effectively.
